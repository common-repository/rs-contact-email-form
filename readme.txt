The RegEX in the contact form does the following field validation:
[a-zA-Z0-9 ]: only letters, spaces and numbers allowed in the name field; special symbols are deemed invalid.
[a-zA-Z ]: only letters and spaces are allowed in the subject field.
The email form control validates the email field hence there is no need for a pattern attribute.
The contact form shortcode [rs_contact_form] is active.
